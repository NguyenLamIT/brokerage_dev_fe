            <span className="">After <Link color="primary" className="text-blue-800" href="/help-center/seller/user-guides/register">registering as a supplier</Link>, the next step is to publish your supplier profile.</span>
            <div className="pt-6"><span className="">Start by going to <Link color="primary" className="text-blue-800" href="/company-information">Profile</Link> and click the <span className="font-medium">Company information</span> tab.</span></div>
            <div className="pt-6 pb-2">To publish a basic supplier profile, you need to fulfill two requirements:</div>
            <ol className="list-decimal text-xl flex flex-col gap-2 px-6">
                <li className="pl-4">Get verified by uploading your business documents.</li>

            </ol>
            <div className="pt-6"><span className="">The banner at the top will display your status in meeting these requirements.</span></div>
            <h2 className="pt-10 pb-6 ">Get verified</h2>
            <span className="">
                Trade4go  is designed to be an environment for verified buyers and suppliers to interact based on trust. Thus, only verified buyers and suppliers may participate in Trade4go 's B2B Marketplace.
                <div className="pt-6">You may become a verified supplier by creating an account with a Trade4go -verified work email. If your work email is confirmed as one of Trade4go -verified work emails, you will be identified as a verified company upon completion of registration and will not need to take further steps to become verified. However, we recommend that you provide as many details as possible in the verification details section under your company profile to better demonstrate the validity of your company.</div>
                <div className="pt-6">If you have not registered with a Trade4go -verified work email, it is mandatory to upload your business documents and become verified to participate in the platform. The verification process is conducted by Trade4go  and is free of charge.</div>
            </span>
            <div className="pt-6 pb-2">How to upload your business documents:</div>

                <li className="pl-4">If your business documents are rejected, this means that Trade4go  was unable to verify the documents as certified or that the documents did not match your company information. Please follow any instructions provided in the email and re-upload your documents after making the appropriate changes.</li>
                <li className="pl-4">Once your business documents are approved and a product is uploaded, your profile will be published.</li>
